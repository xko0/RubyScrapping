NE LANCEZ PAS LE 3EME ! cest TROP long !!
DO NOT EXECUTE THE THIRD ONE. IT TAKES TOO LONG


My first program named ruby_scrapping.rb can give you 20 cryptos and their actual values !

The 2nd one, "mairie_christmas" will get the mail for each city of "val-d'oise".

the 3rd one is a bonus one, it's working perfectly fine But DO NOT LAUNCH ! it takes too much time :p
but it will give you the full name of all the deputies and their mails.
